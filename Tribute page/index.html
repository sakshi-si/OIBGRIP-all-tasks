                <h2> Indian social reformer</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Savitribai Phule</b> was an Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra. Along with her husband, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule in Maharashtra, she played an important and vital role in improving women's rights in India.
                    She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist movement. Savitribai and her husband founded one of the early modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. Robert May of the London Missionary Society was the first
                    person to open a school exclusively for girls in the region of Chinsurah, Bengal, in 1818. She worked to abolish the discrimination and unfair treatment of people based on caste and gender.

                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <p>
                    Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 in the village of Naigaon in Satara District, Maharashtra. Her birthplace was about fifteen km (9.3 mi) from Shirval and about 50 km (31 mi) from Pune. Savitribai Phule was the youngest daughter of Lakshmi and
                    Khandoji Nevase Patil, both of whom belonged to the Mali Community. She had three siblings. Savitribai was married to her husband Jyotirao Phule at the age of 9 or 10 (he was 13). Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of their own.It
                    is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this. It is said when Yashwant was about to get married, no one was willing to give him a girl because
                    she was born to a widow. Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization's worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February 1889.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Jyotirao educated Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar, his cousin sister at their home along with working at their farm. After completing her primary education with Jyotirao, her further education
                    was the responsibility of his friends, Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.[additional citation(s) needed]She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs; the first was at institution run by an American
                    missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Pune. Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress.
